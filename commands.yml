###  create .gitignore and add the file that you don't want git to track

 .gitignore

##  If your  commit message has an error and you want to correct it do

git commit -m "first commit" --amend 

# To reset all the changes in the staging area to the working area do

git reset .

# This command create a new branch.

git branch branchname

# This command allows you to switch from one branch to another. 

git checkout branchname

## List all of the branches in your repository

git branch --list

# Create a new branch called ＜branch＞. This does not check out the new branch.

git branch -d <branch>

# Delete the specified branch
# This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents 
# you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.

git branch -D <branch>

# Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes.
# This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of 
# the commits associated with a particular line of development.

git branch -m <branch>

# Rename the current branch to ＜branch＞.

git branch -a

# Creating remote branches
$ git remote add new-remote-repo https://github.com/Devops-pro-group/git
# Add remote repo to local repo config
$ git push <new-remote-repo> <branch>~
# pushes the new branch to new-remote-repo

# Deleting Branches local

git branch -d <branch>

# This deletes the branch regardless of its status
# and without warnings, so use it judiciously.

git branch -D <branch>

# The previous commands will delete a local copy of a branch. 
# The branch may still exist in remote repos. To delete a remote branch execute

git push origin --delete <branch>

# This will push a delete signal to the remote origin repository 
# that triggers a delete of the remote branch

git push origin :<branch>

# This command tells the local repository that there are changes 
# available in the  remote repo without bringing them in the local repository.
git fetch

# This command brings the copy of the remote repo to the local repo.
git pull 

# Used to merge specific commit in a branch
git cherrp-pick (CID)

# Command used to integrate changes from another branch.
git merge

# It separates each commit that has been done 

git rebase

# git workflow

working area -- staging ---local repository  =---> remote repository

# To see the changes that happen when you change  to a different branch

git diff
